# _Jobi - an Online Job Tracker_

When I started the job search process, I used an Excel file to organize all the jobs I've been applied for and later, I found a site that allows doing the same thing more conveniently. But I felt it was very basic and lacking features that could further facilitate the process, so I'm happy to introduce you to Jobi - my version of a job tracking site.

Jobi allows you to keep track of job applications in a convenient and organized way, update job status easily, view a job timeline from the moment you apply, through a conversation with a recruiter until you get the job. In addition, there's a statistical analysis that allows you to see how many jobs you have submitted so far, in the current week and more. All you have to do is log in with your Google account and start tracking.
